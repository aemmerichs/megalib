# Project Megalib 
* The first component is a collection of illustrative megamodels as a set of .megal files in './models/'.
* The second component is a Java program 'checker' that can be used to check the well-formedness of a .megal file.
* The third component is a Java program 'visualizer' that can be used to transform textual models to a visual representation, e.g., as dot-files.
* Further documentation can be found in the project's Wiki (see https://github.com/softlang/megalib/wiki).
